You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This project has been created to use react for the purposes of learning and implementing the thing i learn from this into other projects, the course can be found on https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/overview.
